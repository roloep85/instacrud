Front-End Developer Test Task: Create a Dynamic CRUD Interface
Objective:

We are seeking a talented front-end developer to showcase their skills in creating intuitive and visually appealing web interfaces. Your task is to develop a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) frontend application. This application should interact with one of the freely available web APIs on the internet, demonstrating your ability to work with external data sources, manage state, and present data in a user-friendly format.

Requirements:

API Selection: Choose a free web API that offers a range of data and functionality (such as RESTful services related to social media, weather, music, movies, or any other area of interest). The API should require operations that include creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources.

Design and User Experience: Craft an engaging user interface that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive to navigate. Your design should prioritize usability, making it easy for users to interact with the data presented by the API.

Functionality: Implement the full spectrum of CRUD operations:

Create: Allow users to add new data entries to the API.
Read: Display data retrieved from the API, ensuring it's presented in a clear and organized manner.
Update: Enable users to modify existing data entries.
Delete: Provide a mechanism for users to remove data entries.
Responsiveness: Ensure the application is responsive and delivers a seamless experience across devices of various sizes.

Code Quality: Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code. Your application's structure should be logical, with components and functionalities appropriately organized.

Deliverables:

A link to a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub) containing your project's source code or a zip file 
A README file that includes:
An overview of the chosen API and a rationale for its selection.
Instructions on how to set up and run your application.
A brief description of the application's architecture and any libraries or frameworks used.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Design aesthetic and user experience.
Completeness and functionality of the CRUD operations.
Code quality, including readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.
Responsiveness and cross-device compatibility.
Creativity and originality in solving the given task.
We are excited to see your innovative approaches to solving this challenge.
